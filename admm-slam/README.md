ADMM-SLAM
===================================================
This library is an implementation of the algorithm described in Exactly Sparse Memory Efficient SLAM using the 
Multi-Block Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (IROS 2015). The core library is developed in C++
language.

ADMM-SLAM is developed by [Siddharth Choudhary](mailto:siddharth.choudhary@gatech.edu) and 
[Luca Carlone](mailto:lcarlone@mit.edu) as part of their work at Georgia Tech. 

Prerequisites
------

- CMake (Ubuntu: `sudo apt-get install cmake`), compilation configuration tool.
- [Boost](http://www.boost.org/)  (Ubuntu: `sudo apt-get install libboost-all-dev`), portable C++ source libraries.
- [GTSAM](https://bitbucket.org/gtborg/gtsam) develop branch, a C++ library that implement smoothing and mapping (SAM) framework in robotics and vision. Here we use factor graph implementations and inference/optimization tools provided by GTSAM. To install a particular commit of GTSAM follow the following instructions: 

```
$ git clone https://bitbucket.org/gtborg/gtsam
$ git checkout b7c695fa71efd43b40972eec154df265617fc07d -b admm
$ mkdir build
$ cmake ..
$ make -j8
$ sudo make install
```

Compilation & Installation
------

In the cpp folder excute:

```
$ mkdir build
$ cd build
$ cmake ..
$ make -j3
$ make check  # optonal, run unit tests
```

Run Experiments
------

```
$ cd scripts
$ bash runADMMOnSyntheticData.sh 
$ bash runADMMOnBenchmarkData.sh 
```
